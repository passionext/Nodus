- Linux command-line tools: `top`, `free`, `df`, `ss`, `curl`, `ping`

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/passionext/Nodus.git
cd Nodus
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Make Scripts Executable
chmod +x stats.sh network.sh

5. Configure Script Paths
In main.py, ensure paths to stats.sh and network.sh are correct.
Relative paths (e.g., ["bash", "network.sh"]) are recommended if scripts are in the same directory as main.py.

6. Run the Application
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
The server will be available at: http://<your-server-ip>:5000

💻 Usage
System Stats: http://<your-server-ip>:5000/dashboard

Network Stats: http://<your-server-ip>:5000/network-dashboard
